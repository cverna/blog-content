I have recently watched this great [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUnRKf2CemA) by Michael Brody-Waite. Michael is talking about 3 principles: be authentic, surrender the outcomes and do uncomfortable work. These principles resonated with me and made me think about myself and How I am doing against them. In his talk, he also tells us about how he has been using the quite famous *"What is your greatest weakness ?"* interview question to get people to be authentic and talk about themselves. What follows is me answering this question.

Over the last couple of years, I started to realize that my greatest weakness was a lack of courage. Not the courage that relates to bravery but the courage of being vulnerable, being uncomfortable with others. I learned that I value a lot of connections with others, taking actions that put these connections at risks scares me.

Often that lack of courage is materialized by fear and insecurity. Questions like, *"Am I good enough? "*, *"What do others think about me? "*, *"Should I say that? "*, start to become inhibitors and restrain my capacity to take actions. As an example I have been living in Poland for the last 4 years, and my Polish language skills are far from being great. The main reason for me not having made better progress is that speaking in polish makes me uncomfortable. I am feeling vulnerable, judged, and I start doubting myself. *"Will I be understood? "* *"Will I understand others? "*" This is hard and it feels much better to stay in my comfort zone.

Recently, I learned that the word courage comes from the Latin *cor* which means *heart*, its original definition is *"to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart"*. I find that definition excellent, it emphasizes the fact that being yourself and true about yourself is hard. Looking forward, I want to push myself to be more vulnerable and speak more about my weaknesses and fears. I believe this can have a strong impact in today's world. Let's be more authentic instead of pretending to have a perfect life, showing off on social media, and using filters to hide our weaknesses.
